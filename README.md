# heartdiseaseprediction
In this project, we have created a Heart Disease Prediction System. This system has the ability to detect whether a given individual is suffering from heart disease with an accuracy of upto 85%. The system makes use of two classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest and compares the accuracy for the 2 algorithms.
